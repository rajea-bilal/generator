# Progress Log

- 2025-09-09: Added Fast Start wizard (`routes/brand-fast-start.tsx`) with 3 steps (brand basics, look & feel, colors). Registered route in `app/routes.ts`. Brand Kit now reads query params to prefill name, template, font, icon, and colors. Adjusted preview to stay square and fully visible. No linter errors.
- 2025-09-09: Moved icon selection into Fast Start Step 2 (added `IconPicker`). Removed icon controls from `brand-kit.tsx` so icon choice is made in the wizard. Typecheck clean.
- 2025-09-09: Changed default `iconId` to empty (no icon). Updated renderer to handle empty/unknown `iconId` gracefully (renders background + text only). Avoids forcing rounded square by default.
- 2025-09-09: Added conditional icon controls to Brand Kit: shows "Add icon" when none; moves "Change/Remove icon" under Advanced when present. Typecheck clean.
- 2025-09-09: Restyled Advanced sliders to match reference UI (uppercase labels, dark track, prominent thumb). No new parameters added; just visual changes.
- 2025-09-09: **Device Mockup Implementation**: Added device mockup functionality with 3 new view tabs (Browser, Phone, iOS) displaying generated icons in realistic contexts. Created `BrowserMockup`, `IPhoneMockup`, and `NativeIOSMockup` components that position the generated brand icon within actual device mockups (browser favicon, iPhone X profile avatar, iOS app icon). Successfully integrated with existing preview system. Working implementation shown in screenshot with iOS tab selected displaying the generated icon as an app icon on iPhone home screen.
