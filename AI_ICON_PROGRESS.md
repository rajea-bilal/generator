# AI Icon Generator Progress

**Started**: September 8, 2025

## What This Feature Does
Create SVG icons from text prompts using AI. Users can type what they want (like "shopping bag") and get a clean SVG icon that looks like Lucide icons.

## Progress Log

### Part 1: Setup & Dependencies ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Added required packages: `svgo` and `fast-xml-parser` (zod was already there)
- Checked that TypeScript can read JSON files (it can)
- Confirmed Convex actions work (they do)
- Made sure project compiles without errors (it does)

**Status**: All setup complete. Ready for Part 2.

### Part 2: Shared Types ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Created `app/lib/icon/types.ts` with clean TypeScript interfaces
- Added `StyleRecipe` type for icon styling (grid size, stroke width, etc.)
- Added `GenerateIconInput` type for user requests
- Added `GenerateIconResult` type for API responses
- Created Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Set Lucide defaults: 24×24 grid, 1.5px stroke, rounded caps/joins, outline style

**Status**: Type system complete. Ready for Part 3.

### Part 3: LLM Provider (OpenAI) ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Created `app/server/llm/provider.ts` with clean IconLLM interface
- Built OpenAI-compatible provider that calls `/chat/completions`
- Added strict system prompt: outputs only valid SVG, no code fences or text
- Created smart user prompt builder that includes style requirements and seed SVG
- Added response cleaning to strip accidental code fences
- Built `getProviderFromEnv()` to read LLM config from environment variables
- Low temperature (0.1) for consistent icon generation

**Status**: LLM provider complete. Ready for Part 4.

### Part 4: SVG Sanitize & Security ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Created `app/server/svg/sanitize.ts` with comprehensive SVG security
- Added XML parsing with fast-xml-parser for safe SVG processing
- Built whitelist of allowed elements: svg, g, path, circle, rect, line, etc.
- Built whitelist of allowed attributes: viewBox, fill, stroke, d, transform, etc.
- Added security checks that reject: `<script>`, `<image>`, `javascript:`, `url()`, event handlers
- Enforces viewBox="0 0 24 24" and style-specific attributes (stroke-width, linecap, etc.)
- SVGO optimization with safe presets (keeps viewBox, removes dimensions)
- Returns detailed warnings for any sanitization changes

**Status**: SVG sanitization complete. Ready for Part 5.

### Part 5: Convex Action ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Created `convex/icons.ts` with clean, minimal generateIcon action
- Added Zod validation for all inputs with proper error messages
- Integrated seed icon loading from `public/lucide-subset.json`
- Connected LLM provider and SVG sanitization pipeline
- Built style merging with LUCIDE_DEFAULTS as base
- Added comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- Returns clean `{ svg, warnings }` response format
- Uses `v.any()` for flexible input validation (validated by Zod inside)

**Status**: Convex action complete. Ready for Part 6.

### Part 6: Client UI Integration ✅ DONE
**Date**: September 8, 2025

**What we did:**
- Created `app/components/AIPanel.tsx` with clean, minimal UI
- Added prompt input with Enter key support
- Added "Match selected icon's style" toggle (default: true)
- Integrated Convex `useAction(api.icons.generateIcon)` hook
- Built loading states and error handling
- Created Switch component for style matching toggle
- Integrated AIPanel into existing brand-kit.tsx page
- Added `aiSvg` state to parent component
- Modified preview rendering to use AI SVG when available
- AI SVG temporarily replaces selected icon in brand preview
- Auto-resets AI SVG when user selects new icon from grid
- Keeps existing brand text overlay and styling intact

**Status**: Client UI complete. Ready for Part 7.
